# Remove Historical Backups

The files under the `.history` folder are deprecated backups. They have been marked with a deprecation notice.  
**Next steps:**  
- Verify that the active files are up to date.
- Review and clean up the `.history` folder periodically.
- Remove the `.history` folder once the backups are no longer needed.
